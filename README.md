# MusiCity - music web page

The start of open source.
Hello everyone, I am new here with my new project to contribute in open source. I am also inviting you to all contributors to contribute in my project.

Its an simple web based music player, I had made in my college project and I want to extend their features and over all things.

If you support, then I will learn more from you to all🙏🏻😅.

Let's get started!


Fork it!🥳

Thank You! Buddies 😊
