# MusiCity - Simple web ðŸŽ¶music player.

This is My College time project, that I made. On that I haven't so much knowledge about technologies and programming. But Google and github help me a lot to complete.
I have learned some basics knowledge of Python and Web development, then I started work on simple idea(music player).

## Idea

At that time, The main idea of this project is to make a web page and application, that have many features like: 

* Music and Video Player 
* Multi platform application
* Make it open for developers
* Add Automatic Subtitle genration
* Add voice assistant

After making simple web page, I have submitted this project in my college and decided to continue, But because of some problems I can't...
This Project helps me a lot to learn and understand new things better like workflow, actions, open-source, development  and all.

## Run the code 

Just go into the code directory and type

## Apply Migrations 

Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. Theyâ€™re designed to be mostly automatic, but youâ€™ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.
Now suppose you want to change my album'm model or song's model and have your's you can simply change the code as you require and then run these commands
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate 
python manage.py runserver
```
