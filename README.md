# MusiCity - Simple web music player.

This is My College time project, that I made. On that I haven't so much knowledge about technologies and programming. But Google and github help me a lot to complete.
I have learned some basics knowledge of Python and Web development, then I started work on simple idea(music player).


## Idea
At that time, The main idea of this project is to make a web page and application, that have many features like: 

* Music and Short Video Player 
* Video and Audio editor
* Open source

After making simple web page, I have submitted this project in my college and decided to continue, nut some probelms I can't...

This Project helps me a lot to learn and understand new things better like workflow, actions, open-source, development  and all.
